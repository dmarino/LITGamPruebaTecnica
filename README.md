------------
This is a little example of a FPS using unity, there are three guns in the scene

- A projectile Gun that shoots in a parabolic trajectory
- A magnetic Gun that attracts objects to the projectile
- A bubble Gun that encapsulates objects in a bubble for certain amount of time

------------

You can play with a game controller or with mouse and keyboard

## Controller:
- Player Movement = left joystick
- Camera Movement = right joystick
- PickUp Gun = (X or Square)
- Drop Gun = (B or circle)
- Shoot = Right Trigger

## Mouse and Keyboard
- Player Movement = WASD or Key Arrows
- Camera Movement = mouse 
- PickUp Gun = E
- Drop Gun = Q
- Shoot = Left Click

- Quit = ESC

-----------
Caveeats and errors: 

- The camera is a little wonky with the mouse, with more time i would've smooth it out with a lerp
- I didn't like the information i stored in the Scriptable objects, i didn't know if i had to store the projectile info too but i think that made my code a little dirty

-----------

Other Thoughts: I hope i'ts okay i used other assets aside from the ones you guys gave me.
